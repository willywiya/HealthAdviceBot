    <h1>🌬️ Breathing Exercises</h1>
    <p>We recommend the following simple breathing technique to help with breathing difficulty:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>🪑 Sit upright and relax your shoulders.</li>
        <li>👃 Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 seconds.</li>
        <li>⏸️ Hold your breath for 7 seconds.</li>
        <li>💨 Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds.</li>
        <li>🔁 Repeat this cycle 3–4 times.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>💡 This is called the 4-7-8 method. It's great for calming anxiety and improving airflow.</p>
